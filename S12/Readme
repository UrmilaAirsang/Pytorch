Assignment A:
Download this TINY IMAGENET dataset. 
Train ResNet18 on this dataset (70/30 split) for 50 Epochs. Target 50%+ Validation Accuracy. 
Submit Results. Of course, you are using your own package for everything. You can look at this  for reference.


Assignment B:
Download 50 (min) images each of people wearing hardhat, vest, mask and boots. 
Use these labels (same spelling and small letters):
hardhat
vest
mask
boots
Use this to annotate bounding boxes around the hardhat, vest, mask and boots.
Download JSON file. 
Describe the contents of this JSON file in FULL details (you don't need to describe all 10 instances, anyone would work). 
Refer to this tutorial . Find out the best total numbers of clusters. Upload link to your Colab File uploaded to GitHub.
