#Tasks

1. Load tiny imagenet data set of 200 classes
2. Run Resnet18 model
3. with 50 epocs reach >50% accuracy

--------------------------------------------------------------------

##Achieved : **56.03%** using tinyimage net with Resnet model  

Remarks:
Learnings:
1. modification of Resnet18 at avgpooling and number of classes
2. load the tiny imagenet data in the content folder not in the drive, because 
it will take more in loading sometime freezes the colab   
3. StepLR or ReduceLROnPlateau lr stepping should be done for every epoch and for cyclic stepping its for each iteration hence to be done with the training function
