#Tasks

1. write a code for trigular wave generator
2. create the custom resnet model
3. find lrmin and lrmax
4. Don't use Annihilation
5. Use horiflip, cutout, crop in image augmentation

--------------------------------------------------------------------

##Achieved : **89%** using Custom Resnet model with Albumentation 

Remarks:
Learnings:
1. calculating Step up and step down for cyclicLR depending on the iterations
2. checked with OnecycleLR and studied on hyperparameters
3. LRfinder using nll_loss gave good results, need to check why not using crossentropy
