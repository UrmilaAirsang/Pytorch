#Creating Seperate files

1. Created seperate files for data loader, model, train, test
2. included Resnet18 model in model file
3. Computed mean and standard deviation for CIFAR10 data
4. used mean and std to normalize CIFAR10 data
5. tried to used weights for different classes


##Achieved : 86.55% using Resnet18 model

Remarks:
##Could acheive desired percent > 85% using normalization of data,
but Model is overfitting, we can improve more by using regularizations and different image augamentation techniques
